# Poyters
Poyters is my own brand single page application. I hand-coded it in the newest Angular version. Provides easy inject presentation data mechanism. Poyters web app provides nice and easy space for custom users where they can find the best of my projects (mainly games). Also business newcomers find here something for them like my Portfolio.
